## Why use Dengtab

During daily computer work, we often unconsciously open social media sites, entertainment sites, and other distracting websites, then forget about the truly important tasks at hand. Or perhaps you're trying to reduce your time on social media but can't resist the temptation.

After installing "Dengtab", you can set a list of specified URLs. When you visit these sites, a focus-reminder page will pop up first, reminding you that you should perhaps finish your current work first.

## Two different mode

### üïú Countdown mode

When visiting specified websites, a countdown page will pop up. Only after the countdown ends can you decide whether to continue visiting the site.

### üßò Meditation mode

When visiting specified websites, a page guiding you through a meditation and focus exercise will pop up. You can first practice meditation and focus, then decide whether to continue visiting the site.

Meditation durations are recorded, and you can view your cumulative meditation time on the settings page. This mode not only prevents distractions but also helps you develop a good habit of daily meditation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my browsing history be uploaded?

No. The extension uses Chrome's tabs API to get the URL of the currently open tab. This data is only used on your local computer and will not be uploaded to any server. The extension also does not request any permissions that could obtain your personal identification.
